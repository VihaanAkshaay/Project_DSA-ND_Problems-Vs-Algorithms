# Project Problems-Vs-Algorithms
##Data Structures and Algorithms - Udacity Nanodegree

This project expected me to answer seven questions that covered a variety of topics related to the basic algorithms I had learned in this course. This repository has clean and efficient answers in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency and design choices of the code.
